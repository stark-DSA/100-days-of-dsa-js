# Day 1 - Two Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

## Approach
Use a hash map to store the numbers and their indices. While iterating, check if `target - current_number` exists in the map.

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

## Code
